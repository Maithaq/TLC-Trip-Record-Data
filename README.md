# New York City Taxi - Yellow Taxis Trip
 [Maitha Alqahtani](https://github.com/Maithaq) & [Arwa Alolyani](https://github.com/ArwaEssa/GUI-tcl)
 # Abstract
 New York City has a huge population that moves from place to place, which means taxi rides are a major part of the traffic. Almost half of the people of New York rely on public transportation, and it is estimated that 54 percent don't own a car or personal vehicle. As a matter of fact, 200 million taxi trips are made annually. The amount of taxi we will need to pay will only be known after we arrive at our destination, and our awkwardness makes us curious about how we can predict this amount, and an accurate estimation will help us control our budget.
 # Design
 This project is one of the T5 Data Science BootCamp requirements. Data provided by from :
 
-  the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission [TLC](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page).
-  NYC Taxi Zones data from [NYC OpenData](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/NYC-Taxi-Zones/d3c5-ddgc)
-  [Central Park](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GHCND/stations/GHCND:USW00094728/detail) weather data from the National Climatic Data Center.
 
 # Data
 we selected a sample of basic data of New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) containing more than 6 million rows and created a million-row sample and 18 columns and This data is lacking coordinates for each location, so we downloaded from NYC OpenData as the (GeoJSON) file containing 263 columns and 9 rows as well weather data for jan month in 2020 from Central Park weather data from the National Climatic Data Center containing 4595 columns and 9 rows.
 
 # Algorithms
**1. Download and read data**
 - Choosing 1,000,000 as a random sample
 - Divide the data into 3 sections: Training, Verification and Test
 
**2. Quick Look at the Data Structure**

**3 . Prepare the Data for Machine Learning Algorithms**
- Delete null values
- Deleted all values with less than 0 passengers
- Deleted all values below 2.5 in the fare amount
- Remove all points outside of New York
- Deleted all values less than 0 in the distances

**4. Feature Engineering**
- Extract longitude and latitude from geometry columns using geopandas 
- Calculation of actual distance by latitude and longitude
- Convertir date columns type to date type
- Extract the day, hour and time from the date columns
- Merging weather data for New York on January 1, 2020

**5.Models**
- Looking for Correlations
- Create linear regression model for predict fare amount
- Training and Evaluating on the Training Set
- Evaluate the Test Set

 # Tools 
 **Library :** 
 - Pandas for Data Analysis and Manipulation
 - Scikit-learn for modeling
 - Matplotlib for plotting 
 - Numpy for work with arrays
 - yellowbrick for visualize the machine learning models
 - GeoPandas  to work with geospatial data
 - Folium for visualizing geospatial data
